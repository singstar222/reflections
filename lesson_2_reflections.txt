What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	The current directory will be a repository and
	Git metadata files will be created in the repository.
	By doing this we can create commit to use Git to keep track of the files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	When you create a commit, all the files in the staging area will be tracked.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

	Git can help to automatically merge the changes of 2 branches which save 
	the effort to do it manually. However, sometimes we need to do it manually 
	to resolve the code conflict between the changes of 2 branches which 
	couldn't be done by Git's automatic merging.
