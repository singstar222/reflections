How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Ensure that the only desired changes are introduced in the new version.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can see how a new change is added on top of the old codes by looking at the history.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	Manually choosing when to create a commit can ensure each version is logical and can be compiled,
	but users may forget to save enough versions from time to time.
	Having version automatically saved can ensure there are decent amount of versions saved,
	but the version may not be logical or can't even be compiled.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	GIT is a version control system for programming.
	In coding, sometimes several files are interrelated.
	Changes in one file will lead to changes in another files.
	Document in google doc are more general files and unlikely to be interrelated.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	By using git log, you can view all the commit history which you have made before.
	By using git diff, you can then view the difference of each commit.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Version control can let your program return to a previous version which doesn't break something.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use GIT for version control for my future projects.
