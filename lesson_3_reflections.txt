When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I'm not using my own PC.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because sometimes may be my friend updated my remote repository and I 
    don't want my local to have those changes yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branches are experimental changes or another versions of the main project.
    Clones are used to copy the respository from remote or local to local.
    Forks are used to clone the respository from GitHub repository to GitHuB
    repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
