When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I'm not using my own PC.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because sometimes may be my friend updated my remote repository and I 
    don't want my local to have those changes yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branches are experimental changes or another versions of the main project.
    Clones are used to copy the respository from remote or local to local.
    Forks are used to clone the respository from GitHub repository to GitHuB
    repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It will let you know the changes in the remote before merging them with 
    the sources in local.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    May be only one source can be edited by one person each time.
    It would be easier because no need to learn new tools.
    It would be harder because it's difficult to merge different changes by 
    different people manually.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    I want to make changes in a separate branch so that the other collaborators 
    can review it before merging the changes in the master branch.
    Make changes in a separate branch will make control easiler.
    Make changes in a master requires less review work to be done.
